# React Photo Gallery of my Great Western Road Trip of 2019.

## Description

_Duration: 8 hours_

For this project I used React to create a photo gallery of highlights from a road trip I took across the Western United States in 2019.  I made each photo clickable to toggle between photos and descriptions of the photos using conditional rendering.  I also included a 'like' button for each photo with a 'like' count below the button.  In order the get the photos on the page and to count likes I used Axios Get and Put calls.
